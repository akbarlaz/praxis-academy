NAME
       npm - javascript package manager

SYNOPSIS
       npm <command> [args]

VERSION
       3.5.2

DESCRIPTION
       npm  is  the package manager for the Node JavaScript platform. It puts modules in place so that node can find them, and manages dependency conflicts intelli‐
       gently.

       It is extremely configurable to support a wide variety of use cases. Most commonly, it is used to publish, discover, install, and develop node programs.

       Run npm help to get a list of available commands.

INTRODUCTION
       You probably got npm because you want to install stuff.

       Use npm install blerg to install the latest version of "blerg". Check out npm help npm-install for more info. It can do a lot of stuff.

       Use the npm search command to show everything that´s available. Use npm ls to show everything you´ve installed.

DEPENDENCIES
       If a package references to another package with a git URL, npm depends on a preinstalled git.

       If one of the packages npm tries to install is a native node module and requires compiling of C++ Code, npm  will  use  node-gyp  https://github.com/TooTall‐
       Nate/node-gyp  for  that  task. For a Unix system, node-gyp https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp needs Python, make and a buildchain like GCC. On Windows,
       Python and Microsoft Visual Studio C++ is needed. Python 3 is not supported by node-gyp https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp. For more  information  visit
       the node-gyp repository https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp and the node-gyp Wiki https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp/wiki.

       See npm help 5 npm-folders to learn about where npm puts stuff.
